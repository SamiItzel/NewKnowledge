		<h1>Welcome to our Web site!</h1>

		<p>We have designed this site to teach you about the wonders
		of <strong><em>XHTML</em></strong>. <em>XHTML</em> is
		better equipped than <em>HTML</em> to represent complex
		data on the internet. <em>XHTML</em> takes advantage of
		XML's strict syntax to ensure well-formedness. Soon you
		will know about many of the great new features of
		<em>XHTML</em></p>

		<p>Have Fun with the Site!</p>
